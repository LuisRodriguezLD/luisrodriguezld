# Who am I?
Self taught Full-Stack Javascript Developer with more than 4 years of experience in programming and over 10 years of experience in graphic design. I am what you call a #Desigrammer

It's true, with a bachelor's degree in a Graphic Design and great passion for Javascript I am confident we can build a great piece of software together.

Worth mentioning, bilingual (también hablo español), musician & gamer in my spare time. Kinda wish I had more...
